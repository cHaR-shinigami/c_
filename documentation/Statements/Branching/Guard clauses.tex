Guard clauses check if some condition is satisfied or not:
if yes, then normal control flow is not interrupted; otherwise,
subsequent statements are skipped till the end of the nearest
enclosing block that supports the use of \tt{break} statement,
and control jumps directly to the end of that block.
Guard clauses are supported by iteration blocks, switch blocks, and any C\_
block that can be lexically closed with \tt{end} or \tt{refed} (discussed later).
