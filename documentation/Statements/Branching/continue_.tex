\head{Syntax}

\tt{continue_ (} \it{condition} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{condition} shall be a scalar expression.
\tt{continue_} shall be used only within an iteration block,
or a C\_ block that can be lexically closed with \tt{end} or \tt{refed}.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{continue_} executes the \tt{continue} statement only if
\it{scalar-expression} does not evaluate to zero.
If the nearest enclosing block that supports \tt{continue_} is not
an iteration block, then its behavior is same as that of \tt{break_}.
