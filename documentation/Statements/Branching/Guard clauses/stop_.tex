\head{Syntax}

\idx{stop_}\s\s\s\tt{(} \it{condition} [\tt{,} \it{return-value}\opt]  \tt{)}

\idx{stop_1_}\s\tt{(} \it{condition} \tt{)}

\idx{stop_2_}\s\tt{(} \it{condition} \l\tt{,} \it{return-value}\opt\r\ \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

The \tt{stop_} family shall have precisely the same
constraints as those applicable for the \tt{guard_} family.

\head{Semantics}

Behavior of the \tt{stop_} family is equivalent to that of the
\tt{guard_} family with \it{condition} being logically negated.

\note Early exit happens with \tt{stop_} family if \it{condition}
is non-zero; \tt{guard_} family does it otherwise.
