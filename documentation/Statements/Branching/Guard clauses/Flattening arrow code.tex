Arrow-shaped code is a lexically deep nesting of blocks
that visually resembles an arrowhead if indented properly.

\example
The following artificial code snippet highlights the arrow (anti-)pattern.

\code{Statements/Branching/Guard clauses/Flattening arrow code/arrow.txt}

Non-trivial arrow code can be hard to read and maintain in large projects,
which is why many programmers consider it to be an anti-pattern that should be
avoided; such code can be easily flattened in C\_ with guard clauses.

\example The arrow-shaped code contrived earlier can
be restructured to eliminate nesting, as done below.
