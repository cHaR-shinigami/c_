\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{#1}\input{Statements/Declarations/#1}}

Syntactically, declarations are not statements; they are described
here as the amount of content does not justify a separate chapter.
Over the years, ISO C revisions have made two
major amendments in the rules of declarations.

\begin{itemize}

\item Firstly, mixing declarations and statements is permitted since C99;
earlier a declaration was not allowed to follow a statement,
and the workaround was to enclose a subsequent declaration within an inner block.

\item Secondly, C23 permits a declaration to immediately follow a label;
it was earlier forbidden due to a grammatical restriction, and a simple
workaround was to add a null statement (a semicolon) just after the label.

\end{itemize}

Some features of C\_ are in fact declarations;
we have already seen one of them in the previous chapter:
\tt{typedef_} is a declaration that creates a pair of type synonyms.
Here we shall discuss two other kinds of declarations.
