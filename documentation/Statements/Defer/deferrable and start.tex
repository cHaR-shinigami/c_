A function that supports the use of \tt{defer_} is started with
\tt{deferrable} instead of \tt{begin} or a plain opening brace.
If statements are to be postponed to the end of an inner block,
then such a block is started with \tt{start};
reaching its corresponding \tt{refed} executes the statements
deferred within that block in reverse order of registering them.

\example The following code demonstrates execution
sequence of deferred statements within nested blocks.

\code{../compile/defer.c_}

\note Asterisk means that the reference implementation relies
on non-standard extensions for providing these features;
they are reported by \tt{-Wpedantic} (enabled in \tt{cc_}),
but we can suppress such warnings with \tt{-Wno-pedantic}.
