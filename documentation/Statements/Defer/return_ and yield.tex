A conventional \tt{return} is oblivious of \tt{defer_},
so the pending statements do not get executed.
\tt{return_} takes an expression that is compatible with the function
return type, that is to say, it should be possible to return that
value without an explicit type cast; the expression is first evaluated,
and then deferred statements are executed starting from the innermost block,
moving to outer blocks in the order of their ending.
When deferred statements of the function block started with \tt{deferrable}
has been executed, the expression that was evaluated earlier is returned.

\tt{return_} cannot be used if function return type is \tt{Void_};
as \tt{return} keyword is unaware of pending statements,
an early return should be written as \tt{yield;} which returns
from the function after executing the deferred statements.
