An implementation can impose a upper bound on the number of \tt{defer_}
statements that can be registered by a single function; this limit is available
as the macro \tt{DEFER_MAX}, which expands to a non-negative integer constant.
The behavior is implementation-defined if the number of \tt{defer_} statements
registered at runtime exceeds this limit; an implementation that does not have
this limit shall still define the macro \tt{DEFER_MAX}, which shall expand to 0.

\note The reference implementation defines \tt{DEFER_MAX} as 128,
which can be changed in the header \tt{<defer._>}.
