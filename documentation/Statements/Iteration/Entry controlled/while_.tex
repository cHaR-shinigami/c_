\tt{end}

\head{Constraints}

\it{loop-condition} shall be a scalar expression.

\head{Semantics}

\it{loop-condition} is evaluated at the start of each iteration:
if it is non-zero, then the loop body is executed, and the expression
is re-evaluated after reaching the end of that \tt{while_} block,
or after executing a \tt{continue} statement;
looping is stopped if the \it{loop-condition} is found to be zero.
