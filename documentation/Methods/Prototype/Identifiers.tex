Each \tt{prototype_} declaration introduces a set of identifiers that
are generated from \it{prefix} and \it{method-name} through name mangling;
the precise naming scheme used by the reference
implementation is described in appendix B.

\note An implementation is also permitted to
declare additional identifiers using reserved names.
