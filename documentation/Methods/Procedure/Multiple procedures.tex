The source file \tt{"Integers/sort._"} containing the
protocol definition is located in \tt{include/} directory.
Examples in this documentation follow a practice of keeping prototype
declarations and protocol definitions in \tt{include/} directory:
files having prototype declarations are included for method
invocations, whereas a file having a protocol definition is included
only by those files that provide a corresponding procedure definition.
Files having procedure definitions are named with \tt{.c_} as filename
extension, and these files are placed within the \tt{compile/} directory.

The following subsections describe two endpoint-based strategies for sorting:
their source codes are available in the files \tt{hourglass.c_} and \tt{burrow.c_},
both located in the \tt{Integers/} subdirectory within the \tt{compile/} directory.
Both of these translation units include the header file
\tt{"Integers/sort._"} containing the protocol definition.

\note As these files provide definitions for the same functions,
at most one of their object codes can be linked.
