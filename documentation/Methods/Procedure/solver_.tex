\head{Semantics}

\tt{solver_} gives mangled name of the function defined by
\tt{procedure_}; this function is also declared by \tt{protocol_}.

\note \tt{prototype_} family does not declare the identifier given by \tt{solver_}:
this is because a procedure can be defined with internal linkage, in which
case the function will not be visible outside of its own translation unit.
