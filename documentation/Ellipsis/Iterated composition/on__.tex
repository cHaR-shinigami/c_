The \tt{o}$n$\_\_ family of function-like macros can be used to
design \tt{o__}, as is done by the reference implementation.

\head{Syntax}

\tt{o}$n$\tt{__ (} \it{function} \tt{,} \it{argument} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

$n$ shall be a non-negative decimal integer constant not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{o}$n$\tt{__(f, arg)} repeats the text \tt{f(arg)} $n$ consecutive times,
as \tt{f(arg)f(arg)} $\cdots$ \tt{f(arg)} ($n$ times);
an invocation of \tt{o0__} expands to blank text.
If \it{function} is a function-like macro,
then each invocation is also expanded as well.

\note Other than the null macro \tt{o0__}, each \tt{o}$n$\tt{__(f, a)}
is defined as \tt{f(a)o}$m$\tt{__(f, a)}, where $m = n - 1$.
