The macro \tt{PP_MAX} expands to the maximum decimal integer constant supported
by ellipsis framework; the reference implementation defines \tt{PP_MAX} as 127,
which is the smallest upper bound on the number of macro arguments.
The behavior is undefined if more than \tt{PP_MAX} arguments
are passed to a feature implemented as a function-like macro.

\note The reference implementation can be easily modified to support
values above 127, up to the maximum number of macro arguments supported
by a given C preprocessor; the necessary steps are described in appendix C.
