\def\Subsubsection#1{\subsubsection{#1}
\input{Ellipsis/Additional utilities/Primality/#1}}

\head{Syntax}

\idx{IS_PRIME_} \tt{(} $n$ \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

$n$ shall be a non-negative decimal integer constant not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX},
or it shall expand to such a constant.

\head{Semantics}

The outcome is \tt{1} if $n$ has at most two divisors;
otherwise the outcome is \tt{0}.

\note By this definition, 1 is considered as prime,
so \tt{IS_PRIME_(1)} is \tt{1}.
