\head{Syntax}

\idx{transpose__} \tt{(} \it{parenthesized-lists} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Each argument shall be a parenthesized list,
and the number of such lists shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

The number of elements in each parenthesized list
shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX} after macro expansions.

\head{Semantics}

Each parenthesized list is considered to be a row of a matrix,
and the outcome is the transpose of such a matrix.
If any list contains fewer elements, then its elements are
reused from the beginning for generating the transpose.

\note Transpose of a transpose restores the original
lists only if all of them have same number of elements.

\example \tt{transpose__((0, a), (1, b), (2, c))}
expands to \tt{(0, 1, 2), (a, b, c)}.
