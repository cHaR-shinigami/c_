\head{Syntax}

\idx{eject_} \tt{(} \it{alpha} \tt{,} \it{omega} \tt{,} \it{parenthesized-lists} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\tt{eject_} shall have precisely the same
constraints as those applicable for \tt{project_}.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{eject_} is complementary to \tt{project_} and performs
inverse projection on a sequence of parenthesized lists:

\noindent for each list, \tt{eject_} drops only those elements that
are selected by \tt{project_}, and retains rest of the elements.

\note The behavior of \tt{eject_} is equivalent to applying
\tt{xslice_} on each list after removing the parentheses.

\example \tt{eject_(1, 2, (A, B, C, D), (a, b, c, d))}
expands to \tt{(A, D), (a, d)}.
