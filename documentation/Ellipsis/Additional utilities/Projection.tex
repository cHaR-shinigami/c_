\head{Syntax}

\idx{project_} \tt{(} \it{alpha} \tt{,} \it{omega} \tt{,} \it{parenthesized-lists} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both \it{alpha} and \it{omega} shall be non-negative decimal integer constants
not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}, or each of them shall expand to such a constant.
Each argument shall be a parenthesized list,
and the number of such lists shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.
Number of elements in each parenthesized list
shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX} after macro expansions.

\head{Semantics}

For each parenthesized list, the elements from index \it{alpha}
through \it{omega} are selected, as if by applying \tt{slice_}
on each expanded list after removing the outermost parentheses.
The outcome for each list is fully parenthesized.

\note \it{alpha} is compared with the adjusted value
of \it{omega} in the same way as done by \tt{slice_}.

\example \tt{project_(1, 2, (A, B, C, D), (a, b, c, d))}
expands to \tt{(B, C), (b, c)}.
