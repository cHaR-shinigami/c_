Almost all features of ellipsis framework are constrained by preprocessing
limits: these decimal integer constants are available as object-like
macros named entirely in uppercase and prefixed with \tt{PP_}.
They also limit the domain of non-negative integers over which arithmetic,
logical, and relational operations can be performed using the preprocessor.
