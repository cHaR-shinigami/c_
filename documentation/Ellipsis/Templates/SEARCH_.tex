\head{Syntax}

\tt{SEARCH_ (} \it{predicate} \tt{,} \it{arg2} \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\tt{SEARCH_} shall have precisely the same
constraints as those applicable for \tt{FILTER_}.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{SEARCH_} generates an index list for elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} that would be selected by \tt{FILTER_}.

\note As always, the expanded \it{argument-list} is
indexed from left to right starting at index zero.

\example \tt{SEARCH_(EQ_, 10, 0, 10, 1, 10)} generates
\tt{1, 3} which is the list of indices at which ten is found.
