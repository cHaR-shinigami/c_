\head{Syntax}

\idx{compress_} \tt{( (} \it{argument-list} \tt{) ,} \it{binary-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Number of elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.
Elements in \it{binary-list} up to the length of expanded \it{argument-list}
are significant: each such element shall expand to the decimal integer
constant \tt{0} or \tt{1}; at least one significant element shall be \tt{1},
and excess elements shall not violate preprocessing constraints.

\head{Semantics}

An element in the expanded \it{argument-list} is included in the outcome
if the index-wise corresponding element in \it{binary-list} is \tt{1};
otherwise the associated element in \it{binary-list} is \tt{0}
and the element in \it{argument-list} is not selected.

\it{binary-list} is considered to be circular, so if it is
exhausted before \it{argument-list}, it is read again from the start;
excess elements in \it{binary-list} beyond the length of
\it{argument-list} are unused, but they are still scanned as usual.

\note Due to the constraint that \it{binary-list} shall not be all zeros,
at least one element will always be selected.

\example \tt{compress_((a, e, i, o, u), 0, 1)} expands to
\tt{e, o} as the pattern repeats like \tt{0, 1, 0, 1, ...}
