\head{Syntax}

\idx{except_} \tt{(} \it{period} \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{period} shall be a non-negative decimal integer  constant
not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}, or shall expand to such a constant.

The number of elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

\head{Semantics}

\it{argument-list} is expanded and if \it{period} is not zero, then
the first element in the resulting list is not included in outcome;
thereafter every element at an interval of \it{period} is
skipped (from left to right), and the rest are included.

Equivalently, \it{argument-list} is expanded and then its
elements are indexed from the left starting at index 0.
The outcome contains precisely those elements whose
index is not an integer multiple of a non-zero \it{period}.
Index 0 is a multiple of any \it{period}; however, if \it{period} is zero,
all elements are included (for \it{period} 1, all elements are skipped).

\example \tt{except_(2, a, e, i, o, u)} expands to \tt{e, o}
which is complementary to the outcome of \tt{select_}.
