\head{Syntax}

\tt{get_ (} \it{index} \tt{,} \it{default-argument} \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{index} shall be a non-negative decimal integer constant
not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}, or expand to such a constant.

\head{Semantics}

\it{default-argument} and a comma are prepended before \it{argument-list},
and the resulting sequence is expanded; the first argument of the augmented
list is removed after expansion, which acts as the default text.
After truncating the augmented list, its elements are indexed from
0 left to right, and if an element exists at the given \it{index},
then that is the outcome; otherwise the default text is produced
(first element of the augmented argument list after expansion).
