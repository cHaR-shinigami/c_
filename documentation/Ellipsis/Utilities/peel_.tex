\head{Syntax}

\tt{peel_ (} \it{text} \tt{)}

\head{Semantics}

If \it{text} has a parenthesized prefix, then \tt {peel_}
removes its outermost parentheses; otherwise it is not changed.

\note \tt{peel_} should be used with caution, as it can cause undesirable changes
if \it{text} is not fully parenthesized, but contains a parenthesized proper prefix:
for example, \tt{peel_((1 + 2) * 3)} alters the expression to \tt{1 + 2 * 3}.
