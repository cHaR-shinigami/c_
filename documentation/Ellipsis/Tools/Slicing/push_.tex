\head{Syntax}

\tt{push_ (} \it{graft} \tt{,} \it{index} \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{index} shall be a non-negative decimal integer constant not
exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}, or shall expand to such a constant.

The number of elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

\head{Semantics}

\it{argument-list} is expanded first, and elements in the
resulting list are indexed left to right starting at index zero.
Let there be $n$ elements in the expanded list,
so that its last element has index $n - 1$.
If \it{index} exceeds $n$, then it is adjusted to $n$.
\it{graft} is injected at the adjusted index position, and if that position is
not $n$ (end of the list), then subsequent elements from that index onward
(before grafting) are pushed to the right, keeping their existing order.

\note Multiple elements can be grafted by wrapping with
a macro such as \tt{echo_}, making it a single argument.

\example \tt{push_(echo_(u, s), 1, p, h)} expands to the text \tt{p, u, s, h}.
