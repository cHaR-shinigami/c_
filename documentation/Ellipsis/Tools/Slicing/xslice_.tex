\head{Syntax}

\tt{xslice_ (} \it{alpha} \tt{,} \it{omega} \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both \it{alpha} and \it{omega} shall be non-negative decimal integer constants
not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}, or each of them shall expand to such a constant.
The number of elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

\head{Semantics}

\it{argument-list} is expanded first, and elements in the
resulting list are indexed left to right starting at index zero.
Let there be $n$ elements in the expanded list,
so that its last element has index $n - 1$.
If \it{omega} is not less than $n$, it is adjusted to $n - 1$.
If \it{alpha} exceeds the adjusted value of \it{omega},
then outcome is the entire expanded list;
otherwise elements in the index range from \it{alpha} through
\it{omega} are excluded, and rest of them appear in the outcome.

\note \tt{xslice_} is complementary to \tt{slice_},
as it includes precisely the elements that are excluded by \tt{slice_}.
