\head{Syntax}

\tt{xhead_ (} $n$ \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

$n$ shall be a non-negative decimal integer constant not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX},
or it shall expand to such a constant.

The number of elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

\head{Semantics}

Macros in \it{argument-list} are expanded.
If the resulting number of arguments is greater than $n$,
then the outcome is  blank; otherwise first $n$ arguments from the
expanded list are excluded, and rest of them appear in the outcome.

\note \tt{xhead_} is complementary to \tt{head_},
as it includes precisely those elements that are excluded by \tt{head_}.
