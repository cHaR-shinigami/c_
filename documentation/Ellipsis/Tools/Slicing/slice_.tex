\head{Syntax}

\tt{slice_ (} \it{alpha} \tt{,} \it{omega} \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both \it{alpha} and \it{omega} shall be non-negative decimal integer constants
not exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}, or each of them shall expand to such a constant.
The number of elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

\head{Semantics}

\it{argument-list} is expanded first, and elements in the
resulting list are indexed left to right starting at index zero.
Let there be $n$ elements in the expanded list,
so that its last element has index $n - 1$.
If \it{omega} is not less than $n$, it is adjusted to $n - 1$.
If \it{alpha} exceeds the adjusted value of \it{omega},
then the outcome is a blank text;
otherwise the outcome contains all elements of the expanded list in
the index range from \it{alpha} through \it{omega} (both inclusive).

\note \tt{slice_(alpha, omega, ...)} is equivalent to
\tt{xhead_(alpha, head_(INC_(omega), __VA_ARGS__))}.
