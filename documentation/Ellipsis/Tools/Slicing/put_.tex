\head{Syntax}

\tt{put_ (} \it{clobber} \tt{,} \it{index} \tt{,} \it{argument-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

If \it{clobber} expands to an unparenthesized list,
then the number of elements in that list shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

\it{index} shall be a non-negative decimal integer constant not
exceeding \tt{PP_MAX}, or shall expand to such a constant.

The number of elements in the expanded
\it{argument-list} shall be less than \tt{PP_MAX}.

\head{Semantics}

\it{argument-list} is expanded first, and elements in the
resulting list are indexed left to right starting at index zero.
Let there be $n$ elements in the expanded list,
so that its last element has index $n - 1$.
If \it{index} exceeds $n$, then it is adjusted to $n$.
If \it{clobber} expands to a list of length $m$, then $m$ elements starting
from the adjusted index are replaced by \it{clobber}; if there are fewer than
$m$ elements from the adjusted index, the list is extended on right side.

\example \tt{put_(echo_(a, p), 0, m, a, p, l, e)}
expands to the text \tt{a, p, p, l, e}.
