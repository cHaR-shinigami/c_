\def\Section#1{\section{#1}\input{Build/#1}}

The build script mentioned in the introductory chapter can be used to generate
object files by compiling the source files in \tt{compile/} directory, and placing
them in the \tt{object/} directory, having an identical subdirectory structure.

In this appendix, we shall describe the contents of the shell script used
to automate the build process on Unix-based environments, along with a brief
overview of the command-line options used for \tt{gcc} and \tt{clang} compilers.
