A new data can be appended to a collection only if it is a
valid instance of the collection's type (or its sub-type).

In order to impose this requirement as a pre-condition, \tt{Collection}
overrides \tt{append} method of its base interface \tt{Iterable};
implementation of the procedure is trivial and identical
to the code for \tt{append} procedure of \tt{Iterable}.
