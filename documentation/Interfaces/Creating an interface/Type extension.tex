\input{Interfaces/Creating an interface/Type extension/#1}}

Every interface declaration creates a structure with the tag
\tt{Typex (}\it{interface-name}\tt{)}, which is forward declared by
\tt{Interface_(}\it{interface-name}\tt{)} and structure members are defined by
\tt{interface_(}\it{interface-name}\tt{,} \it{members-list}\tt{)}.
\type{Typex} is a portmanteau of ``\tt{Type} e{\bf x}tension'',
as this structure extends the \tt{Type} structure with additional members.

The first member is named as \tt{base}, which is a singleton array
with element type \tt{struct Typex (}\it{base-interface}\tt{)}.
For each \it{member-name} in \it{members-list}, the corresponding structure
member is declared with the same name, as pointer to a function having the same
type as the procedure \tt{solver_(}\it{interface-name}\tt{,} \it{member-name}\tt{)}
(note that \tt{prototype_} declares the procedure's type only);
members are declared in the same sequence as in \it{members-list}.

The \tt{Abstract} type also creates a structure with the tag \tt{Typex (Abstract)};
it is a slight misnomer to call it a \tt{Type} ``extension'', since it contains a
single member \tt{base} declared as a singleton array with element \tt{struct Type}.
