\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{#1}\input{Interfaces/Concretization/#1}}

Concretization means defining a structure for materializing
an abstract data type described by an interface, and providing
functions that can operate on instances of the concrete structure.
This structure is provided by a class declaration,
and for each member in the \tt{Typex} structure declared by an interface,
the class declares a prototype for a corresponding method whose procedure
implements the necessary functionality required by the interface.

A concretizing class is said to ``implement'' an interface: an interface can be
implemented by multiple classes, and a single class can implement multiple classes.
The implementation relationship between a class and an
interface is established with the help of object-like macros,
which are required by declarations as well as definitions.
