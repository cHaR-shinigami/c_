\input{Interfaces/More examples/Vector class/#1}}

The core concepts on interfaces have already been demonstrated with several
examples, so for the sake of brevity, we shall discuss only the declaration
and definition of the \tt{Vector} class, along with its concretization
of \tt{Iterable} and \tt{Collection} interface; interested readers
can find the protocols and procedures collectively in appendix A.
