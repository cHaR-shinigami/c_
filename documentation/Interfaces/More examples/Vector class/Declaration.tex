Unlike \tt{Chain} and \tt{List} that implement a linear linked list,
\tt{Vector} uses an array of pointers.
The class structure contains four members: \tt{array} points to the base element
of an array of \tt{Void} pointers; \tt{capacity} stores the maximum number
of elements that can be stored with an existing allocation of \tt{array},
while \tt{count} maintains the number of elements already stored in the array
(from index zero); \tt{species} is required for the \tt{Collection} interface.

\tt{Cursor} structure is used as an iterator, and the class
method \tt{cursor} implements the interface method \tt{iterator};
the latter is established by the pair \tt{(iterator, cursor)}
in the replacement text of \tt{Vector_IMPLEMENTS_Iterable}.
