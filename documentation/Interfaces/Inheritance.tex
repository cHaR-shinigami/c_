\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{#1}\input{Interfaces/Inheritance/#1}}

Inheritance relationship between two interfaces can be established in
the same way as done for classes; we have already seen an example of this
in the \tt{Iterable} interface, which extends the \tt{Abstract} type.
Now we shall discuss an example of multi-level inheritance with interfaces,
by creating another interface \tt{Collection} that extends \tt{Iterable}.
