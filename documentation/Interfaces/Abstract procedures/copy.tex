\tt{Abstract_ *solver_(Abstract, copy)(Abstract_ *this, Abstract *that);}

\head{Description}

As per the protocol of \tt{copy} method, \tt{this} is considered to be the
destination pointer, and \tt{that} is considered to be the source pointer.
If \tt{is(that->type, type_(Abstract))} is
\tt{false}, then a null pointer is returned.
Otherwise if \tt{that} is not null and the pointer \tt{that->concrete}
compares equal to the pointer \tt{this->concrete}, then \tt{this} is returned.
If \tt{this->concrete} is not null and either the concrete \tt{type} is not valid
or not a sub-type of \tt{concrete_(that)->type}, then a null pointer is returned.
Otherwise the \tt{copy} procedure of \tt{concrete_(that)->type} is
invoked with \tt{this->concrete_} and \tt{that->concrete} as arguments.
If its outcome is null, then a null pointer is returned;
otherwise its outcome is a pointer to a copy of \tt{that->concrete},
and if it is same as \tt{this->concrete}, then \tt{this} is returned.
Otherwise a new \tt{Abstract} instance is allocated, whose \tt{type}
member is initialized with the \tt{type} parameter, and \tt{concrete}
member is initialized with the pointer that was returned by
\tt{concrete_(that)->type->}\\\tt{copy(this->concrete, that->concrete)}.
The return value is a pointer to the initialized \tt{Abstract} instance.
