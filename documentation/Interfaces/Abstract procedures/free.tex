\head{Declaration}

\tt{Void_ solver_(Abstract, free)(Abstract_ *this);}

\head{Description}

If \tt{this} is a null pointer or \tt{is(this->type, type_(Abstract))}
is \tt{false}, then the procedure returns immediately.
Otherwise if the concrete instance is not a null pointer and its \tt{type}
member is valid (as determined by \tt{is_type}), then the concrete instance
is deallocated by calling \tt{concrete_(this)->type->free(this->concrete_)}.

In any case, \tt{free(this)} is invoked to
deallocate the abstract instance before returning.
