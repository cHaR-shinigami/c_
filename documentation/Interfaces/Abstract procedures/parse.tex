\tt{Abstract_ *solver_(Abstract, parse)(Abstract_ *this, Size_ *length, Void *in);}

\head{Description}

\noindent If \tt{is(this->type, type_(Abstract))} is \tt{false},
or \tt{this->concrete} is null, or \tt{is_type(concrete_(this)->type)}
is \tt{false}, then a null pointer is returned.
Otherwise the \tt{parse} procedure of \tt{concrete_(this)->type} is
invoked with \tt{this->concrete_}, \tt{length}, and \tt{in} as arguments.
If the outcome of the call is null, then a null pointer is returned;
if the outcome is same as \tt{this->concrete}, then \tt{this} is returned.
Otherwise a new \tt{Abstract} instance is allocated, whose \tt{type} member
is initialized with \tt{this->type}, and \tt{concrete} member is initialized
with the earlier outcome of calling \tt{concrete_(this)->type->parse}.
The return value points to the initialized \tt{Abstract} instance.
