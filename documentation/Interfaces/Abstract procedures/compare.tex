\tt{LLong_ solver_(Abstract, compare)(Abstract *this, Abstract *that);}

\head{Description}

If either \tt{this->type} or \tt{that->type} is not a descendant
of \tt{type_(Abstract)}, then the return value is one.
Let $super$ denote the nearest common ancestor given by
\tt{super(concrete_(this)->type, concrete_(that)->type)}.
Then the return value of the comparison is the outcome of
$super$\tt{->compare(this->concrete, that->concrete)}.
