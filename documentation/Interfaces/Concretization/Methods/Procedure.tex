If a new node cannot be allocated, then zero is returned.
Otherwise the members \tt{data} and \tt{next} are initialized
to the parameter \tt{data} and null pointer; the latter is
done because the new node will be set as the \tt{tail} node.
If the existing value of \tt{this->length} prior to incrementing is non-zero,
then the chain is non-empty, and the new node is linked
to the \tt{next} member of the current \tt{tail} node;
otherwise the chain is empty and the new node is set as the \tt{head} node.
In any case, the new node is set as the \tt{tail}
node before returning \tt{1}, which indicates success.
