\def\Subsubsection#1{\subsubsection{#1}\input{Interfaces/Concretization/Methods/#1}}

For each class method that provides an implementation for an interface method,
the concrete protocol can leverage the abstract protocol
which already establishes pre-conditions and post-conditions.
This promotes code reusability: if an interface is concretized by multiple
classes, then each of their protocols need not re-implement the same logic.

In this subsection, we have only described the implementation of \tt{append}
method for the \tt{Chain} class; rest of the concretizing methods are implemented
in a similar way, and their source codes can be found in appendix A.

\note A concrete protocol can also specify its own set of pre-conditions and
post-conditions specific to the class structure, in addition to those that
are already imposed by the corresponding abstract protocol of the interface.
