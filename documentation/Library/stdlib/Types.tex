The following type synonyms are defined, and in each case,
the modifiable twin is named with a trailing underscore.

\table{llllll}

\type{Div}       & \type{LDiv} & \type{LLDiv} &
\type{Once_flag} & \type{Size} & \type{WChar}\\

Additionally, if both macros \tt{__STDC_LIB_EXT1__} and
\tt{__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__} remain defined before including \tt{<stdlib._>},
the following synonyms are defined with modifiable counterparts:
\type{Errno}, \type{Rsize}, \type{Constraint_handler}.
