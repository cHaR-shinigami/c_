The function-like macros \idx{uabs_}, \idx{ulabs_}, and \idx{ullabs_} are
non-trivial wrappers over the functions \tt{uabs}, \tt{ulabs}, and \tt{ullabs}.
These macros conditionally invoke their respective functions only if their
argument has a signed type; otherwise the argument value is cast to the
unsigned return type of the corresponding function, without calling it.

\note If the argument happens to be unsigned, calling the
functions directly can cause signed overflow if the argument
value cannot be represented in the signed parameter type.
The wrapper macros avoid such predicaments.
