\tt{<stdlib._>} provides inline definition for the following
additional function that serves as a wrapper over \tt{malloc}.

\table{l}
\tt{Void_ *}\idx{malloc2}\tt{(Size, Size);}
\elbat

The primary use of this function is to detect whether the mathematical value of
the product of arguments can be represented in the type \tt{Size}: if yes, then
\tt{malloc} is invoked with that product; otherwise a null pointer is returned.
