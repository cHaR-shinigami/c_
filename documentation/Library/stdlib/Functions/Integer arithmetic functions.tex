\tt{<stdlib._>} provides inline definitions for the following
additional functions to get the absolute value of an integer.

\table{l@{\qquad\qquad}l@{\qquad\qquad}l}

\tt  {UInt_} \idx  {uabs}\tt{(Int);}  &
\tt {ULong_} \idx {ulabs}\tt{(Long);} &
\tt{ULLong_} \idx{ullabs}\tt{(LLong);}\\

\elbat

These functions return unsigned types, so obtaining the absolute value of the
most negative integer representable in the parameter type does not cause any
signed overflow, and the behavior is well-defined for all signed values.
