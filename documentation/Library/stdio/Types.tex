\tt{File_} and \tt{Fpos_} are synonyms for \tt{FILE} and \tt{fpos_t},
with \type{File} and \type{Fpos} being the non-modifiable counterparts.

Additionally, if both macros \tt{__STDC_LIB_EXT1__} and
\tt{__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__} remain defined before including \tt{<stdio._>},
then the synonyms \type{Errno} and \type{Rsize} are also defined,
corresponding to the types \tt{errno_t} and \tt{rsize_t}.
