\tt{<math._>} provides the type synonyms \type{Float_t} and \type{Double_t}.

Additionally, if both the macros \tt{__STDC_IEC_60559_DFP__} and
\tt{__STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__} remain defined before including \tt{<math._>},
then the type synonyms \type{Decimal32_t} and \type{Decimal64_t} are also provided.
