\type{Size} is defined as a synonym for non-modifiable \tt{size_t},
with \tt{Size_} being its modifiable counterpart.

Additionally, if both macros \tt{__STDC_LIB_EXT1__} and
\tt{__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__} remain defined before including \tt{<string._>},
then the synonyms \type{Errno} and \type{Rsize} are also defined,
corresponding to types \tt{errno_t} and \tt{rsize_t}.
