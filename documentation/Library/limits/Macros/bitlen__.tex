\head{Syntax}

\tt{bitlen__ (} \it{bitmax} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{bitmax} shall have an integer type.

\head{Semantics}

If \it{bitmax} is a non-negative integer that is one less than some power of 2,
then \tt{bitlen__} acts as the inverse of \tt{bitmax_}, and computes the number
of significant bits; otherwise the behavior is implementation-defined.

The result is an integer constant expression only if the
argument \it{bitmax} is also an integer constant expression.

\note The reference implementation provides \tt{bitlen__} with a formula
suggested by Hallvard B. Furuseth; the basic technique can be found at
