If exact-width types are supported by the implementation,
then the following synonyms are provided by \tt{<stdint._>}.
In each case, the modifiable counterpart \tt{UInt}$N$\_ is a synonym for
\tt{uint}$N$\tt{_t}, and \tt{Int}$N$\_ is a synonym for \tt{int}$N$\tt{_t}.

\table{rrrr}

\type{UInt8} & \type{UInt16} & \type{UInt32} & \type{UInt64}\\

\type {Int8} & \type {Int16} & \type {Int32} & \type {Int64}\\
