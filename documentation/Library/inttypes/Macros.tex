\tt{<inttypes._>} additionally defines the following function-like macros:
\idx{uintmax_}, \idx{gcd_}, \idx{umax_}, \idx{umin_}, \idx{smax_}, \idx{smin_}.

\tt{uintmax_} exhibits well-defined behavior for large
unsigned integers that cause signed overflow with \tt{uintmax}.

\tt{gcd_}, \tt{umax_}, \tt{umin_}, \tt{smax_}, and \tt{smin_}
generalize the respective functions with fold/reduce operations;
if a single argument is given, then that is the outcome after
conversion to \tt{UIntmax} or \tt{Intmax} (as per the return type).
The sequence of evaluation of arguments is unspecified.

\note The reference implementation provides generalization
macros using \tt{reduce__} from ellipsis framework.
