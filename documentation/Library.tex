C\_ extends the C standard library with type definitions and some new functions.
Minor extensions include trivial wrappers over standard function-like macros,
named as per the C\_ convention of a trailing underscore,
to differentiate them from actual functions.
C23 specifies 31 standard headers whose names end with \tt{.h},
and for each of them, C\_ provides an extension header whose name
ends with \tt{._}: each C\_ header includes its corresponding C
header as a base, and provides C\_ style type definitions along
with wrapper macros for the components of the base header.

Sections of this chapter are organized as per standard headers:
each section lists the extensions provided by a particular C\_ header.
Details about standard types have been omitted for brevity:
only the names are mentioned, and as always,
their modifiable twins are named with a trailing underscore.
Wrapper macros retain the same meaning as their base
macros from the standard library: their only purpose is
to ensure a uniform naming scheme as per C\_ conventions.
For some headers, the reference implementation also tries to bridge
the gap between C18 and C23, by implementing new features of the
current C standard if they are not already provided by the compiler.

\note In few cases, an extension header is only a wrapper
that includes a C header without any new content.
