\head{Syntax}

\tt{min_ (} \it{type-name} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{type-name} shall specify an arithmetic type, but not a complex type.

\head{Semantics}

\idx{min_} returns the minimum value that is representable with
the type given by \it{type-name}; it is zero for unsigned types,
and for floating-point types, it is the smallest absolute value.
The outcome is of the same type as \it{type-name}.
