If complex types are available, then an implementation
can optionally provide the corresponding imaginary types:
\type{Fimaginary}, \type{Dimaginary}, and \type{LDimaginary}.
If complex types are present, the implementation provides the header
\tt{<complex.h>}; the macro \tt{imaginary} is defined in \tt{<complex.h>}
if and only if imaginary types are available as well.
