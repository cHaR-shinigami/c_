The optional decimal floating-point types are \type{Decimal32}, \type{Decimal64},
and \type{Decimal128}, which if available, conform to the ISO/IEC 60559
formats \it{decimal32}, \it{decimal64}, and \it{decimal128} (respectively).
These are listed in increasing order of rank,
with \tt{Decimal32} having a higher rank than \tt{LDouble}.
Being a conditionally supported feature introduced in C23,
these types are provided iff the macro \tt{__STDC_IEC_60559_DFP__}
is defined by the implementation.
