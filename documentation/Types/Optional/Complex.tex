\def\Subsubsection#1{\subsubsection{#1}\input{Types/Optional/Complex/#1}}

For each standard floating-point type,
a corresponding complex type can be optionally available:
these are \type{Fcomplex}, \type{Dcomplex}, and \type{LDcomplex},
in non-decreasing order of precision of increasing order of rank.
Values for these types have two parts: real and imaginary;
as always, a higher ranked type can represent all values of a lower ranked type.

Complex types were introduced in C99 as a core part of the language;
however, the C11 revision relegated them to conditional feature,
whose support is available iff an implementation
does not define the macro \tt{__STDC_NO_COMPLEX__}.

\note \tt{<types._>} includes the C\_ library header
\tt{<complex._>} iff complex types are supported by the compiler.
