\idx{is_pointer_} can be used to statically check if the type
of a scalar expression is pointer to a complete object type.

\head{Syntax}

\tt{is_pointer_ (} \it{expression} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{expression} shall have scalar type.

\head{Semantics}

For a scalar expression that is not a pointer to an incomplete type or function
type, \tt{is_pointer_} returns one if the expression evaluates to a pointer
after array to pointer decay (if applicable); otherwise it returns zero.
The outcome is an integer constant expression,
whose type is \tt{False_} for zero, and \tt{True_} for one.

\example \tt{is_pointer_(0)} is false; \tt{is_pointer_((Char *)0)}
and \tt{is_pointer_("array decay")} are true.

\note \tt{is_pointer_} provided by the reference implementation can portably
differentiate between arithmetic type expressions and pointers to complete types;
other implementations can support a broader class of expressions.
