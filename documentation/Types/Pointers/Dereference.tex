The dereference operator \tt{*} can be applied only for a pointer to
complete object type or function type, and only if it points to a valid
object whose lifetime has not ended, or to a function of the right type.
Dereferencing an invalid pointer causes undefined behavior; however,
there are some exceptions where the dereference operation is not performed,
such as applying the address-of operator \tt{&} to the dereferenced expression,
the controlling expression of a \tt{_Generic} selection, \tt{sizeof} and
\tt{typeof} operators without a variably modified type, and pointer to an array.
