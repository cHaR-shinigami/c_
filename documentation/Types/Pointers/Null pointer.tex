Null pointer is a special pointer value that
indicates a non-existent object or function.
The exact value is implementation-defined,
but it is most commonly represented with all zero bits;
moreover, the null pointer representation can be different
for object pointer types and function pointer types.
At source code level, a null pointer is denoted by the null pointer constant,
which is an integer constant expression that evaluates to zero,
or such an expression cast as pointer to \tt{Void};
in other words, whenever the compiler sees 0 (possibly cast
as \tt{Void_ *}) assigned to or compared with a pointer type,
it substitutes an implementation-defined representation of the null pointer.
C23 also allows \tt{nullptr} as another form of null pointer constant;
\tt{nullptr} is a predefined constant of type \tt{nullptr_t}.

\note Portable programs should not use \tt{memset} to initialize some memory
with null pointer(s), as zeroing out a pointer object is not guaranteed to
result in a null pointer; the proper way is to assign the null pointer constant.
