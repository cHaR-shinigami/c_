\type{Bool} is an unsigned type having one value bit,
and an implementation-defined number of padding bits (at least 7);
the single value bit can represent only two values: 0 and 1.
Any scalar expression can be converted to \tt{Bool} and the
converted result is 1 if and only if the expression is non-zero
(for pointers, only null pointer compares equal to 0).

\note Unlike other unsigned types, there is no corresponding signed type for
\tt{Bool}; the optionally supported \tt{BitInt (2)} is the closest substitute.
The result of equality and relational operators is of a boolean nature,
but for historical reasons, its type is actually \tt{Int_};
also, a \tt{Bool} operand is promoted to \tt{Int_} in arithmetic expressions.
