\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{#1}\input{Types/Properties/#1}}

This section describes features that can be used to inspect certain properties
of the execution environment for arithmetic types, excluding complex types;
these function-like features are: \tt{has_sign_}, \tt{isNBO_},
\tt{max_}, \tt{min_}, \tt{width_}, and \tt{precision_}.
All of them require a type name and support integer types,
with \tt{max_} and \tt{min_} also supporting real floating-point types.
The outcome of \tt{has_sign_} is required to be an integer constant expression,
that can be used with enumerators, C11 static assertions, or C23 \tt{constexpr}.
This requirement is not imposed upon rest of the features, though it is
desirable that other implementations can provide them as compile time constants;
the reference implementation only supports this partially
for \tt{max_}, \tt{min_}, \tt{width_}, and \tt{precision_}.
None of these are required to be suitable for use with the \tt{#if}
preprocessing directive; additionally, \tt{isNBO_}, \tt{max_}, \tt{min_},
\tt{width_}, and \tt{precision_} need not work reliably with type inference,
even though all of their outcomes have well-defined types.
