The \tt{at__} and \tt{at_}* families provide a
bounds-checking mechanism for array indexing.
These features can be configured with the \tt{DEBUG} macro before
including the header \idx{<array._>}: the \tt{defined} state of \tt{DEBUG}
is recorded by the macro \idx{ARRAY__} every time \tt{<array._>} is included.
If \tt{ARRAY__} expands to \tt{1}, then \tt{DEBUG} was defined, so \tt{at__} and
\tt{at_}* families are configured in debugging mode, where they assert that the
index is not out of bounds; otherwise \tt{ARRAY__} shall expand to \tt{0}, and
if the index is out of bounds, then a default value can be used (if provided).

Additionally, these features also support negative indexing from the end
(influenced by the Python language).
Negative indexing is done right to left, with the last element being indexed as
-1, and the base element having an index equal to negative of the array length.
Indices always increase when moving from base element to the end.
