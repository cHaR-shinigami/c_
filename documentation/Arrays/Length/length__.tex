\head{Syntax}

\tt{length__ (} \it{pointer-to-array} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{pointer-to-array} shall be pointer to a complete array.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{length__} infers array length from the type of
\it{pointer-to-array}; the outcome is an expression of type \tt{Size_}.
The argument need not be evaluated at all if it does not have
a variably modified type; it may be evaluated more than once
only if element type of the array is itself variably modified.
The behavior is undefined if the pointer is null.
