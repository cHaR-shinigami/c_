\head{Syntax}

\tt{is_array_ (} \it{expression-or-type} \tt{)}

\head{Semantics}

If \it{expression-or-type} does not have a variably modified type,
then the outcome is \tt{TRUE} if the argument is an array, and \tt{FALSE}
if it is not an array; otherwise the behavior is implementation-defined.
The outcome is a constant expression whose type depends on the argument,
so it can be used as the controlling expression of a generic selection.

\note The reference implementation does not support
variably modified types for \it{expression-or-type}.

\example \tt{is_array_("string literal")} is \tt{TRUE},
 whereas \tt{is_array_(&"pointer to array")} is \tt{FALSE}.
