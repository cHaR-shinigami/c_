\head{Syntax}

\idx{bitcount_} \tt{(} \it{pointer-to-array} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{pointer-to-array} shall be pointer to a complete array.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{bitcount_} multiplies \tt{CHAR_BIT} with size of the array
inferred from its type; the outcome is of type \tt{Size_}.

\it{pointer-to-array} need not be evaluated
if it does not have a variably modified type.
