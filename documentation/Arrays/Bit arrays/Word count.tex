\tt{Bits} is an array of \tt{UInt_fast8},
and each array element is called a ``word''.

\tt{wordcount_} calculates the minimum number of
words required to store a given number of bits.

\head{Syntax}

\idx{wordcount_} \tt{(} $bitcount$ \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

$bitcount$ shall be an expression having integer type.

\head{Semantics}

$bitcount$ is first converted to type \tt{Size}, and
\tt{wordcount_} gives the number of words necessary to store
the number of bits given by the converted value of $bitcount$.
The outcome is of type \tt{Size_}.
