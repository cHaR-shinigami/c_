\tt{<reduce._>} defines the macro  \tt{REDUCE__} that configures the
behavior of \tt{reduce_} family; \tt{REDUCE__} records the \tt{defined}
state of \tt{DEBUG} every time \tt{<reduce._>} is included:
it expands to \tt{1} if \tt{DEBUG} was defined, and \tt{0} otherwise.

\head{Syntax}

\tt{# include <reduce._>}

\idx{reduce_}\s\s\s\tt{(} $accumulator$ \tt{,}
$function$ \tt{,} $source$ [\tt{,} $range$] \tt{)}

\idx{reduce_3_}\s\tt{(} $accumulator$ \tt{,}
$function$ \tt{,} $source$ \tt{)}

\idx{reduce_4_}\s\tt{(} $accumulator$ \tt{,}
$function$ \tt{,} $source$ \l\tt{,} $range$\r\ \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

$source$ shall be pointer to a complete array type.
$range$  shall be an expression having a \tt{Range} type.

$function$ shall be a function type expression that can be called with
$accumulator$ as the first argument and an element of $source$ as the
second argument, without requiring any type cast for each argument.

$accumulator$ shall be a modifiable lvalue that can be assigned with the
return value of $function$ without any type cast; additionally, it shall be
possible to obtain a pointer to $lvalue$ with the address-of operator \tt{&}.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{reduce_} invokes \tt{reduce_}$n$\_ if the
expanded argument sequence contains $n$ arguments.
If the length of $source$ array is inferred to be $n$, \tt{reduce_2_}
invokes $function$ $n$ times, with $accumulator$ as the first argument
and an element of $source$ as the second argument: the first invocation
is done with the element at index zero in $source$; subsequent
invocations use the element next to the one for the previous iteration.
For each invocation, the return value of $function$ is stored in
$accumulator$ itself, which is then used in the next iteration (if any).

\tt{reduce_4_} is similar to \tt{reduce_3_}, except that it invokes
$function$ only for the index series specified by $range$.
