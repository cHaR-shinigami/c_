\def\Subsubsection#1{\subsubsection{#1}\input{Arrays/Iterators/Joining/#1}}

\tt{<join._>} defines the macro \tt{JOIN__} that configures the behavior
of \tt{join__} and \tt{join_}* families; \tt{JOIN__} records the \tt{defined}
state of \tt{DEBUG} every time \tt{<join._>} is included:
it expands to \tt{1} if \tt{DEBUG} was defined, and \tt{0} otherwise.
