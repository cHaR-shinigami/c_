C\_ offers several facilities for bitwise operations on resizeable arrays.
Memory is typically byte-addressable,
and individual bits are accessed with bitwise operators.
C\_ provides simple abstractions for performing bit manipulations
over arrays that are interpreted as a packed sequence of bits
(padding bits can be present only at the end).

The reference implementation provides these features in
the header \idx{<bits._>}, most of which can be configured.
