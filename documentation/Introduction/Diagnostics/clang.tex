Most options of \tt{clang} are similar to those of \tt{gcc};
for our purpose, we shall use the following set of options.

\code{Introduction/Diagnostics/clang.txt}

The setting \tt{-fmacro-backtrace-limit=1} works similar
to the \tt{gcc} option \tt{-ftrack-macro-expansion=0}.
As before, a few warnings need to be disabled: in particular,
the exception \tt{-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument}
allows us to look at preprocessed code with the \tt{-E} option,
which does not require linker, so \tt{lib.o} remains unused.
