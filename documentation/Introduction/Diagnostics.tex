\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{#1}\input{Introduction/Diagnostics/#1}}

Modern software development is incomplete without enabling
compile-time diagnostics of suspicious code constructs,
which are usually reported as ``compiler warnings''.
Most professional C developers will use a customized set of options aligned with
the coding standards and business requirements of their production environment.
For compiling examples in later chapters, we shall enable several
warning options that are considered suitable for most purposes.

\note The reference implementation provides the starred features (*) using non-%
standard extensions that need to be compiled with \tt{cc_ -Wno-pedantic} (this
option disables \tt{-Wpedantic} which is part of our \tt{cc_} command alias).
