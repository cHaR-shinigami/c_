\tt{NULLPTR} is the null pointer constant of type \tt{Ptr_(Void_)}.

\note The C standard does not specify a particular type for the macro \tt{NULL},
which can be of integer type, pointer type, or the special type \tt{nullptr_t}
(since C23); the only benefit of \tt{NULLPTR} is that its type is well-defined.
