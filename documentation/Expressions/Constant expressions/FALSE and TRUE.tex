\tt{FALSE} and \tt{TRUE} are differently typed
expressions whose values are of boolean nature.
\tt{FALSE} is an integer constant expression with type \tt{False_} and value zero.
\tt{TRUE}  is an integer constant expression with type \tt{True_}  and value one.

\note The reference implementation provides
\tt{FALSE} and \tt{TRUE} as object-like macros.
\tt{False_} is a synonym for an \tt{enum} having one member:
\tt{FALSE}  with value zero;
\tt{True_}  is a synonym for another \tt{enum} having one member:
\tt{TRUE}   with value one.
Both enumeration constants are masked by macro
definitions that can be used in \tt{#if} directives,
and an expression whose outcome is \tt{FALSE} or \tt{TRUE} can
be further used for \tt{_Generic} selections during translation.
