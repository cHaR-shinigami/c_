\head{Syntax}

\tt{# include <input._>}

\tt{scan_ (} \it{expression-list} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\tt{scan_} shall have precisely the same
constraints as those applicable for \tt{scan__}.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{scan_} evaluates each lvalue in \it{expression-list} exactly once;
rest of the semantics are identical to \tt{scan__}.

\note \tt{scan__} and \tt{scan_} cannot store whitespace in a \tt{Char_} lvalue.
For signed types, if the input (optionally preceded by sign)
starts with \tt{0}, it is interpreted as octal; if it starts
with \tt{0X} or \tt{0x}, it is interpreted as hexadecimal.
