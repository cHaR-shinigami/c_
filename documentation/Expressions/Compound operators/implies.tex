\head{Syntax}

\tt{(} \it{implicant} \tt{implies} \it{implicand} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both \it{implicant} and \it{implicand} shall be scalar expressions.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{implies} checks if a logical implication exists between the two operands:
the result has value one if \it{implicant} is zero or
\it{implicand} is non-zero; otherwise the result is zero.
The result is of type \tt{Int_}, and the operation follows
short-circuit evaluation: \it{implicant} is evaluated first,
and if it is non-zero, only then \it{implicand} is evaluated.

\note The reference implementation provides \tt{implies} as
an object-like macro that expands to \tt{)==0 ||}\s\s\tt{(}
