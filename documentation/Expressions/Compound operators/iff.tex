\head{Syntax}

\tt{(} \it{expression} \tt{iff} \it{expression} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both operands shall be scalar expressions.

\head{Semantics}

\tt{iff} checks logical equivalence of the two scalar expressions:
the result has value one if both operands compare equal to zero,
or both operands compare unequal to zero; otherwise the result is zero.
The result is of type \tt{Int_}.

\note The reference implementation provides \tt{iff} as an
object-like macro that expands to the text \tt{)==0 == !(}
