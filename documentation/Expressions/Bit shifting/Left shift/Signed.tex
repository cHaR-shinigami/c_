\head{Syntax}

\tt{# include <lshift._>}

\idx{lsh_} \tt{(} \it{left-expression} \tt{,} \it{right-expression} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both expressions shall have integer types.

\head{Semantics}

\it{left-expression} is converted to the type \tt{Intmax};
we shall denote this converted value as $n$ and its absolute value $|n|$ as $u$.
\it{right-expression} is converted to an unsigned type;
we shall denote this converted value as $s$.
Let $w$ denote minimum width of the type of
\it{left-expression} before and after conversion.
If shift $s$ is less than width $w$, then $u$ is left shifted by $s$ bits,
as if with \tt{ulsh_(u, s)}; only the least significant $w - 1$ bits of the
shifted value are retained, and sign negation is done if $n$ is negative.
This becomes the outcome after conversion to the type of \it{left-expression}.
