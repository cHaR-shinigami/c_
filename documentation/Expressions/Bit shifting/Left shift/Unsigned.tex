\head{Syntax}

\tt{# include <lshift._>}

\idx{ulsh_} \tt{(} \it{left-expression} \tt{,} \it{right-expression} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both expressions shall have integer types.

\head{Semantics}

\it{left-expression} is converted to the type \tt{UIntmax};
we shall denote this converted value as $u$.
\it{right-expression} is converted to an unsigned type;
we shall denote this converted value as $s$.
Let $w$ denote minimum width of the type of
\it{left-expression} before and after conversion.
If shift $s$ is less than width $w$, then $u$ is left shifted by $s$ bits,
as if with \tt{u << s}; more precisely, if the unsigned value $u$ is expressed
as $\sum_{i = 0}^{w - 1} b_i.2^i$ with the bit pattern $b_{w - 1} \cdots b_0$
(here $b_0$ is the least significant bit), then the result of left shifting
it by $s$ bits has the value $\sum_{i = s}^{w - 1} b_{i - s}.2^i$
with the bit pattern $b_{w - 1 - s} \cdots b_0 0_1 \cdots 0_s$.
This unsigned result is converted back to
the original type of \it{left-expression}.
