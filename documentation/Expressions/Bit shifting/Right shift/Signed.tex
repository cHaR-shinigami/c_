\head{Syntax}

\tt{# include <rshift._>}

\idx{rsh_} \tt{(} \it{left-expression} \tt{,} \it{right-expression} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

Both expressions shall have integer types.

\head{Semantics}

\it{left-expression} is converted to the type \tt{Intmax};
we shall denote this converted value as $n$ and its absolute value $|n|$ as $u$.
\it{right-expression} is converted to an unsigned type;
we shall denote this converted value as $s$.
Let $w$ denote minimum width of the type of
\it{left-expression} before and after conversion.
If shift $s$ is less than width $w$, then the absolute value
$u$ is right shifted by $s$ bits, as if with \tt{ursh_(u, s)};
if $n$ is negative, then sign negation is performed on the shifted value.
This becomes the outcome after conversion
to the original type of \it{left-expression}.
