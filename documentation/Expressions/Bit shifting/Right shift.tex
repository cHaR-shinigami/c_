\input{Expressions/Bit shifting/Right shift/#1}}

The object-like macro \idx{RSHIFT__} records the \tt{defined} state
of \tt{DEBUG} macro when the header \idx{<rshift._>} is included:
it expands to the integer constant \tt{1} if \tt{DEBUG} was defined,
and \tt{0} otherwise; \tt{ursh_} and \tt{rsh_} are configured accordingly.

When \tt{RSHIFT__} expands to \tt{1}, \tt{ursh_}
and \tt{rsh_} are configured in debugging mode, in
which the shift value given by the unsigned right expression is asserted to be
less than width of the left expression's type both before and after conversion;
otherwise \tt{ursh_} and \tt{rsh_} are configured in production mode, in which
the result is zero if shift value is greater than or equal to width of the left
expression's original type or \tt{width_(UIntmax)} (whichever is smaller).
