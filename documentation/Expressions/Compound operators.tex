C\_ has two unusual operators whose semantics can be achieved
by the combined use of unary, equality, and logical operators;
for this reason, we refer to them as compound operators.
Both are useful for expressing logical assertions;
they are frequently used for writing pre-conditions and
post-conditions within protocols (introduced in chapter 6).

Due to the way they are provided by the reference implementation,
both operators require parentheses as part of their syntax.
If the parenthesized expression is part of a larger expression,
then it should be doubly parenthesized, as precedence and associativity are
implementation defined when there are other operators outside the parentheses.
