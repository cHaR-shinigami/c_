C\_ offers debuggable features that simplify
reading formatted input for most common purposes.
A wide variety of data types are supported, and programmers do not need to
remember format specifiers for each type; however, the semantics of processing
the text or wide text input have been described in terms of format specifiers:
this is because the reference implementation provides these
features using the \tt{scanf} family of standard library functions.
As always, other implementations of C\_ need not rely on \tt{scanf} family,
but the semantics should still be preserved,
and input shall be consumed and interpreted in precisely the
same way as prescribed by the \tt{scanf} format specifiers.

The reference implementation provides these features in the header \idx{<input._>}.
An object-like macro \idx{INPUT__} determines the debugging
configuration of all features listed in the following subsections.
If the macro \tt{DEBUG} remains defined when \tt{<input._>} is included,
then \tt{INPUT__} expands to \tt{1}, and the features provided
by \tt{<input._>} are collectively configured in debugging mode,
in which all pointer arguments are asserted to be not null.

If \tt{DEBUG} is not found to be defined when \tt{<input._>} is included,
then \tt{INPUT__} expands to \tt{0},
which configures the features under consideration in production mode,
whose behavior with null pointers is described in the semantics.
