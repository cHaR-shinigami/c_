\head{Syntax}

\tt{need__ (} \it{expression} \tt{)}

\head{Constraints}

\it{expression} shall be a pointer to a complete object type.

\head{Semantics}

If \it{expression} is not null, then that is the outcome;
otherwise a non-null outcome is pointer to a dynamically allocated object,
whose size is same as that of the dereferenced \it{expression}.
The outcome is of the same type as \it{expression}, which can be null only if
\it{expression} itself is null and the required size could not be allocated.

\it{expression} can be evaluated more than once
only if it is pointer to a variably modified type.
