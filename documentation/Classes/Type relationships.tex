\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{#1}\input{Classes/Type relationships/#1}}

Consider the following two class hierarchies:

\begin{itemize}

\item A class \tt{Person} has several derived classes,
one of which is called \tt{Programmer} class.

\item \tt{Phone} class is inherited by \tt{Landline} and \tt{Mobile};
the latter is sub-classed by \tt{FeaturePhone} and \tt{SmartPhone}.

\end{itemize}

We shall use these examples to illustrate type
relationships in the following subsections.

\Subsection{Nearest common ancestor}

\Subsection{Type composition}
