\idx{struct Type} is a collection of pointers that contain
information about identity, lineage, name, and implementation
of a class (concrete type) or interface (abstract type); here
``implementation'' refers to procedures for a fixed set of protocols.
The name \tt{Type_} is a synonym for \tt{Ptr_(const struct Type)},
which means a modifiable pointer to a non-modifiable structure;
its counterpart \tt{Type} specifies that the pointer is also
non-modifiable, which is same as \tt{Ptr (const struct Type)}.
Each class (concrete type) and interface (abstract type)
is characterized by a non-modifiable \tt{Type} property associated
with it, which is declared as an identifier with external linkage.
