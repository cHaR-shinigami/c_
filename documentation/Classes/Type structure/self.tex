\tt{self} is a pointer to non-modifiable \tt{struct Type}.
\tt{self} is the first member of \tt{Type} structure, and for a given \tt{Type}
instance, if \tt{self} points to its own address, it indicates a basic type;
otherwise the \tt{Type} instance is a concrete implementation
of an extended type (interface), and \tt{self} points
to basic \tt{Type} instance of the implementing class.
