Every object-oriented type (class or interface)
extends another type called its base type.
For a given \tt{Type} instance, the member \tt{base} points to the \tt{Type}
structure of the base type which has been extended by the given type.

\note The member \tt{base} is used to establish lineage
all the way to the \tt{Object} class, the topmost ancestor.
