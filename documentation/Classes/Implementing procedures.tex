To complete our example on the wrapper class \tt{Unsigned}, we need
to provide definitions for its procedures that override the default
behavior inherited from \tt{Object} class; the procedures are specified in
\it{override-list} for the macro named as \tt{Unsigned_EXTENDS} in the header
file \tt{Unsigned._}, and they are declared by the \tt{class_} declaration.

\note We have organized each procedure in its own source file;
however, this practice is not necessary.
