\head{Declaration}

\tt{Object_ *solver_(Object, copy)(Object_ *this, Object *that);}

\head{Description}

The procedure returns \tt{this} if it compares equal to \tt{that};
otherwise the return value is a null pointer.

\note If a class provides a non-trivial implementation of \tt{copy},
then the \tt{Object} class \tt{compare} procedure needs to be
overridden as well (either by the same class or by an ancestor).
This is because \tt{solver_(Object, compare)} returns 1 for
two unequal pointers, which would cause a post-condition
violation in the \tt{Type} protocol for \tt{copy}.
