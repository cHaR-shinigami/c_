\head{Declaration}

\tt{Void_ *solver_(Object, text)(Object *this, Size_ *length, Void_ *out);}

\head{Description}

Let $count$ denote the return value of
\tt{snprintf(NULL, 0, "\%s@\%p\\n\\0", this->type->name, (Void *)this)}.

Let $capacity$ denote the existing value of \tt{*length};
\tt{*length} is updated to $count$ before the procedure returns.

If \tt{out} is not null and $count$ does not exceed $capacity$, then
\tt{sprintf(out, "\%s@\%p\\n", this->type->name,} \tt{(Void *)this)}
is called and \tt{out} is returned.
Otherwise \tt{malloc(}$count$\tt{)} is called, and let $des$ be its return value.
If $des$ is not null,
\tt{sprintf(}$des$\tt{, "\%s@\%p\\n", this->type->name, (Void *)this)} is called.
$des$ is always returned.

\note \tt{*length} is always set to $count$ before the procedure returns;
a non-null return value indicates success.
