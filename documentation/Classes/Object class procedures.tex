\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{\idxy{Object}{#1}}
\input{Classes/Object class procedures/#1}}

The \tt{Object} class provides procedures for each \tt{Type} method that has a
corresponding member in the \tt{Type} structure; these functions are basic stubs
with minimal code, just enough to satisfy the post-conditions imposed by protocols.

The expression \tt{type_(Object)} is a pointer to the \tt{Type} structure
of \tt{Object} class: members of this structure provide access to procedures
implemented by \tt{Object} class, as described in the subsections.
Any class using \tt{Object} as base class inherits these procedures in
its own \tt{Type} structure, unless it overrides them with other functions.

The object-like macros \idx{Object_EXTENDS} and
\idx{SELF_C_EXTENDS} are reserved for implementations of C\_.
