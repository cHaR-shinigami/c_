The following procedure code is available in the source file
\src{compile/class/Chain/init.c_}

The implementation first creates a new \tt{Chain} object,
and if the allocation is successful, then its \tt{type} member
is initialized to the argument for \tt{type} parameter.
Rest of the members are initialized as if with the integer constant \tt{0}:
\tt{head} and \tt{tail} are each set to the null pointer, and
\tt{length} is initialized to zero, which indicates an empty list.

\note \tt{(Void) tape} is a pseudo-use of the parameter
\tt{tape}, for suppressing a warning on unused parameters.
