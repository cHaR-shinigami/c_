Implementation of \tt{validate} for \tt{Chain}
is left as an exercise in this chapter.
The following checks can be performed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Both \tt{head} and \tt{tail} must not be null,
or both must be null (\tt{head iff tail}).

\item \tt{length} must be zero if and only if both
\tt{head} and \tt{tail} are null (\tt{length iff head}).

\item The count of distinct nodes from \tt{head}
through \tt{tail} must be equal to \tt{length}.

\item If \tt{tail} is not null, then its \tt{next} member must
be a null pointer (\tt{tail implies}\s\s\tt{! tail->next}).

\end{itemize}

\note In the next chapter, we shall implement \tt{validate}
procedure of \tt{Chain} class using \tt{Iterable} interface.
