The following procedure code is available in the source file
\src{compile/class/Chain/free.c_}

If the parameter \tt{this} does not point to a valid \tt{Chain} object,
then its \tt{head} member is set to a null pointer.
Otherwise, each node is deallocated from \tt{head} through \tt{tail},
and finally the \tt{Chain} object itself is deallocated.

\note We have not used a guard clause for \tt{this} to be non-null,
as it is checked by \tt{free} procedure of \tt{Type}.
