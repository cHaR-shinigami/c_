The \tt{Chain} class does not implement several
procedures associated with \tt{Type} structure.
To overcome this limitation, we can extend the \tt{Chain} class with an
additional \tt{Type} member, and impose a validation rule that each element is
required to be a valid instance of the \tt{Type} specified for a given list.
This is done with another class named  \tt{List}.
