The following procedure code is available in the source file
\src{compile/class/List/init.c_}

If the first element in the \tt{tape} array is not null,
it is expected to be pointer to a \tt{struct Type} pointer,
\tt{Type} being a synonym for \tt{Ptr (const struct Type)}.
If it is not null and does not refer to a valid
\tt{Type} structure, then a null pointer is returned.
Otherwise a new \tt{List} object is created, and on successful allocation,
its \tt{type} member is initialized to the value of \tt{type} parameter$.$
If the first element of \tt{tape} array is not null, it is dereferenced
to get a pointer to a \tt{Type} structure, used to initialize the
\tt{species} of the new instance; otherwise \tt{type_(Object)} is used.
