The method \tt{append} is used to extend a \tt{List} instance at its tail node.
A separate prototype has been declared only because the protocol specifies
pre-conditions in addition to those established by \tt{append} method of
the \tt{Chain} class; the procedure itself is trivial and simply calls the
\tt{append} procedure of \tt{Chain} class, without any extra functionality.

The following procedure code is available in the source file
\src{compile/class/List/append.c_}

\note A prototype does not declare procedure, so
\tt{solver_(Chain, append)} is declared prior to invocation.
