The following code declares a typed linked list;
a similar code is available in \tt{examples/include/class/List._}

\code{Classes/More examples/Typed linked list/List._}

\tt{List} extends the \tt{Chain} class with an additional
member \tt{species}, which is a pointer to a \tt{Type} structure.
For a given \tt{List} instance, each of its elements must point to a
data object that is a valid instance for the \tt{species} of that list.
Recall that due to Liskov substitution, each instance of a derived type is
required to be a valid instance of its base type as well, so instances of
types that extend the given \tt{species} can be added to the list as well.

The macro \tt{List_EXTENDS} establishes an inheritance relationship with the
\tt{Chain} class: more precisely, the implicit member \tt{base} of \tt{List}
class is declared as a singleton array with element type as \tt{Chain}.
\tt{List_EXTENDS} also specifies the procedure names that are overridden
by the \tt{List} class; rest are inherited from the \tt{Chain} class.
