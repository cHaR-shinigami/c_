The function \idx{is_type} performs some basic
validation checks on (pointer to) a \tt{Type} structure.

\head{Declaration}

\tt{Bool_ is_type(Type);}

\head{Description}

The function \tt{is_type} returns \tt{true} if and
only if the following conditions are satisfied:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \tt{Type} argument is not a null pointer.

\item On dereferencing the pointer, each
member of the \tt{Type} structure is not null.

\item The previous rules are recursively satisfied for each
ancestor class, reachable via the array member \tt{base}.

\item The root ancestor \tt{Object} class is
reached within a maximum height of \tt{PP_MAX}.

\end{itemize}

If any of the above conditions fails, then it is not considered
to be a valid \tt{Type}, and the return value is \tt{false}.
