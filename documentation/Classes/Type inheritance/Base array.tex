Declaration of an object-oriented type named $Derived$ requires a
prior macro named $Derived$\tt{_EXTENDS}, and the first element in
its replacement text is considered to be the name of the base type.
The first member in the structure of the derived type is a singleton array
named \idx{base}, whose element type is same as an instance of the base type.

\note The instance attribute \tt{base} is not to be confused
with the pointer member \tt{base} of \tt{Type} structure.
