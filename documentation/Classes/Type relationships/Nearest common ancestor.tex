C\_ uses the term ``super'' in a slightly different sense as
compared to most other object-oriented programming languages.
Super type refers to the nearest common ancestor of two (or more)
object-oriented types; intuitively speaking, super type represents the
largest or most precise intersection between multiple object-oriented types.
