If an instance of some type $A$ contains a member that is (pointer to) an instance
of another type $B$, then $A$ is said to be related to $B$ through composition;
in other words, every instance of type $A$ ``has-an'' instance of type $B$.

For example, if the class structure of \tt{Person} has a member
that is pointer to an instance of class \tt{Phone}, then we
can say that ``\tt{Person} `has-a' \tt{Phone}'' (the sentence
``\tt{Person} `is-a' \tt{Phone}'' would incorrectly suggest inheritance).

\note C predates the advent of object-oriented design,
and C\_ uses composition for structural inheritance.
