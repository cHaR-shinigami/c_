If the return value is $type$, then both the invocations \tt{is(this,}
$type$\tt{)} and \tt{is(that,} $type$\tt{)} return \tt{true}.

\noindent Additionally, if $des$ is any descendant of $type$, then at least
one of \tt{is(this,} $des$\tt{)} or \tt{is(that,} $des$\tt{)} is \tt{false}.

\note If the arguments \tt{this} and \tt{that} compare
as equal pointers, then it is also the return value.
