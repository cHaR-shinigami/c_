If the first element of \tt{tape} array is not null,
then it is interpreted as a pointer to \tt{ULLong},
and the same is dereferenced; otherwise the value zero is used.
If the dereferenced value exceeds \tt{UNSIGNED_MAX}, then a
null pointer is returned. Otherwise a new \tt{Unsigned} object
is allocated; if the allocation fails, a null pointer is returned.
For a successful allocation, the members \tt{type} and \tt{value}
are initialized, and a pointer to the new instance is returned.
