\tt{*length} is expected to be the capacity of \tt{out} array.
If \tt{out} is not null and \tt{*length} is not less than eight, then it is
used for storing the encoding; otherwise an array of eight bytes is allocated.
The length is always set to eight, but if the
allocation fails, then a null pointer is returned.
Otherwise the bits of \tt{this->value} are divided into octets
and stored in little-endian order (less significant octet in
lower address), and a pointer to the encoding is returned.
