Following the established conventions expected by functions like
\tt{bsearch} and \tt{qsort}, the return value is negative if
left value is less than right value, zero if they are equal,
and positive if left value is greater than right value.

\note Directly returning the difference between \tt{this->value}
and \tt{that->value} can cause signed overflow.
