If a valid encoding can be generated for an instance,
then it should be possible to reconstruct that instance by
invoking the \tt{decode} method with the generated encoding.
Unlike the \tt{text} method for generating human-readable
textual representation of an instance, an encoding is
typically binary data and it should characterize an instance.
A single instance can have multiple encodings, but two
distinguishable instances should have different encodings.
