Let $copy$ be the pointer returned on invoking the procedure.
If  $copy$ is not null, then the following must be satisfied:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]

\item \tt{validate(((Object *) that)->type,} $copy$\tt{)} must be \tt{true}.

\item \tt{solver_(Type, compare)(}$copy$\tt{, that)} must be zero;
in other words, $copy$ and \tt{that} must compare equal.

\end{itemize}
