Let $capacity$ be the value of \tt{*length} before invoking the procedure,
and let $text$ be the pointer returned by it.

\begin{itemize}[nosep]

\item The updated value of \tt{*length} must not be equal to zero.

\item If $text$ and $out$ are not null, and updated \tt{*length}
does not exceed $capacity$, then $text$ and $out$ must be equal.

\end{itemize}
