\head{Syntax}

\idx{property_}\s\tt{(} \it{oo-type-name} \tt{,} \it{property-name} \tt{)}

\head{Semantics}

\tt{property_} can be used to create identifiers for
external variables associated with an object-oriented type.

\note The \tt{Type} structure associated with every
object-oriented type can also be considered as a property.

\head{Recommended practice}

Objects declared with external linkage should be non-modifiable;
they are generally stored in read-only segment.
