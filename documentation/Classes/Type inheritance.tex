C\_ provides support for structural inheritance, which is implemented by
``embedding'' an instance of the base type as the first member of its derived type.
This well-known design technique works in C due to the following two rules:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]

\item All structure pointers have identical representation, so pointer to an
instance of a derived type can be interpreted as pointer to an instance of
its base type, without causing loss of information or undefined behavior.

\item There is no padding before the first member of a structure: since every
class structure embeds the structure of its base class as the first member,
pointer to a derived structure is also a valid pointer to the base structure.

\end{itemize}

Both the rules can be applied recursively, which implies that a valid instance
of any class is also structurally valid for any of its ancestor classes
(including the \tt{Object} class, whose sole attribute is the member \tt{type}).
