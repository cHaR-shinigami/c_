\def\Subsection#1{\subsection{\idxy{struct Object}{#1}}
\input{Classes/Object class structure/#1}}

The \tt{Object} class declares \idx{struct Object}
with only one member named \tt{type}.
All classes are related to the \tt{Object} class through inheritance: each class
has exactly one base class, and \tt{Object} is the root ancestor of all classes.

\note The name \tt{Object_} is a synonym for \tt{struct Object},
and \tt{Object} is its non-modifiable counterpart.
